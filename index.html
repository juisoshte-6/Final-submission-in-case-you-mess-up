    <h3>I have been on the other side of the light and I know how dark it can
sometimes feel. I have experienced the hurt and the low spirits. I have felt
 the pain and the loneliness. I just wish that, when I had felt like that,
someone had written me a letter to help me see I am not alone. There was
 no one, but I want to be that person for you. I have realised that most of us
 struggle with our mental health as we experience life's lessons and battles,
but there is always someone else who is going through something similar. It
 might not be the same struggle, but the pain can be very like yours. I hope
that with these letters, you can see that you are not alone in your pain and
that there are ways to overcome your feelings. It is okay that you can't see
 them yet, but you will.</h3>

    maybe you'll never know<br>

why i pushed you away<br>
why i buried my feelings<br>
why i chained my heart<br>
and hid its key<br>
under the deepest sea<br>
because i couldn't allow you to drown<br>
in the never-ending chaos<br>
which was only mine.
